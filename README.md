Godot Pck Tool
==============

A standalone executable for unpacking and packing Godot .pck files.

Command line usage
------------------

For these you just need the GodotPckTool executable. Available from the releases page.

Note: if you don't install it on Linux you need to either use the full
path or put it in a folder and run it as `./godotpcktool` similarly to
Windows.

You can view the tool help by running `godotpcktool -h`

### Listing contents

Lists the files inside a pck file.

```sh
godotpcktool Thrive.pck
```

Long form:

```sh
godotpcktool --pack Thrive.pck --action list
```

### Extracting contents

Extracts the contents of a pck file.

```sh
godotpcktool Thrive.pck -a e -o extracted
```

Long form:

```sh
godotpcktool --pack Thrive.pck --action extract --output extracted
```

### Adding content

Adds content to an existing pck or creates a new pck. When creating a
new pck you can specify which Godot version the pck file says it is
packed with using the flag `set-godot-version`.

```sh
godotpcktool Thrive.pck -a a extracted --remove-prefix extracted
```

Long form:

```sh
godotpcktool --pack Thrive.pck --action add --remove-prefix extracted --file extracted
```

### Filters

Filters can be used to only act on a subset of files in a pck file, or
from the filesystem.

#### Min size

Specify the minimum size under which files are excluded:

```sh
godotpcktool --min-size-filter 1000
```

This will exclude files with size 999 bytes and below.

### Max size

Specify the maximum size above which files are excluded:

```sh
godotpcktool --max-size-filter 1000
```

NOTE: if you use max size to compliment min size extraction, you
should subtract one from the size, otherwise you'll operate on the
same files twice.

However if you want to work on exactly some size files you can specify the same size twice:
```sh
godotpcktool --min-size-filter 1 --max-size-filter 1
```

#### Include by name

The option to include files can be given a list of regular expressions that select only files
that match at least one of them to be processed. For example, you can list all files containing
"po" in their names with:
```sh
godotpcktool --include-regex-filter po
```

Or if you want to require that to be the file extension (note that different shells require
different escaping):
```sh
godotpcktool -i '\.po'
```

Multiple regular expressions can be separated by comma, or specified by giving the option
multiple times:
```sh
godotpcktool -i '\.po,\.txt'
godotpcktool -i '\.po' -i '\.txt'
```

If no include filter is specified, all files pass through it. So not specifying an include
filter means "process all files".

Note that filtering is case-sensitive.

#### Exclude by name

Files can also be excluded if they match a regular expression:
```sh
godotpcktool --exclude-regex-filter txt
```

If both include and exclude filters are specified, then first the include filter is applied,
after that the exclude filter is used to filter out files that passed the first filter.
For example to find files containing "po" but no "zh":
```sh
godotpcktool -i '\.po' -e 'zh'
```

#### Overriding filters

If you need more complex filtering you can specify regular expressions with
`--include-override-filter` which makes any file matching any of those
regular expression be included in the operation, even if another filter
would cause the file to be excluded. For example you can use this to set
file size limits and then override those for specific type:
```sh
godotpcktool --min-size-filter 1000 --include-override-filter '\.txt'
```

### Advanced Options

#### Specifying Engine Version

When creating a .pck file it is possible to specify the Godot engine
version the .pck says it is created with:

```sh
godotpcktool NewPack.pck -a a some_file.txt --set-godot-version 3.5.0
```

Note that this approach **does not** override the engine version number in existing .pck
files. This currently only applies to new .pck files.

### General info

In the long form multiple files may be included like this:
```sh
godotpcktool ... --file firstfile,secondfile
```

Make sure to use quoting if your files contain spaces, otherwise the
files will be interpreted as other options.

In the short form the files can just be listed after the other
commands. If your file begins with a `-` you can prevent it from being
interpreted as a parameter by adding `--` between the parameters and
the list of files.


Building
--------

These are instructions for building this on Fedora, including cross
compiling to Windows.

Note that native Linux build uses the glibc of the currently installed
system, which may be too new for older distros. For a build that
supports those, see the section about podman builds.

### Required libraries

```sh
sudo dnf install cmake gcc-c++ libstdc++-static mingw32-gcc-c++ mingw32-winpthreads-static
```

Also don't forget to init git submodules.

```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then just:
```sh
make
```

Also if you want to make a folder with the executables and cross compile:

```sh
make all-install
```

### Podman build

Podman can be used to build a Linux binary using the oldest supported
Ubuntu LTS. This ensures widest compatibility of the resulting binary.

First make sure podman and make are installed, then run the make
target:
```sh
make compile-podman
```

Due to the use of C++ 17 and non-ancient cmake version, the oldest
working Ubuntu LTS is currently 20.04.
